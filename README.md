This repository demonstrates a subtle data overflow bug in a COBOL program.  The program adds 1 to a numeric field (WS-AREA-1) until it exceeds the defined PIC clause (9(5)). This causes an overflow that is not explicitly handled, leading to unpredictable results. The solution shows how to correctly handle potential overflows using explicit checks or data types with larger capacity.
